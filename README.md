![PoePal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PoePal/PoePal/master/PoePal/Resources/logo.png)PoePal is a 
companion application for [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com) that provides some functionality to
make playing the game more enjoyable, keeping things off your game if you have multiple monitors.

## Install

So far this has only been released on Windows. Download the latest release **[here](https://github.com/PoePal/PoePal/releases/latest)** and run the installer
executable. The install process should be self explanatory.

**Note:** These installers are not signed, so there will potentially be a warning by Microsoft Smart Scan 
until enough people download it. Please double-check the hashes if you're concerned.

## More Info
This application was initially designed for players that have a secondary monitor to provide a dashboard of
sorts along with the game to enhance gameplay. 

### Current functionality

- Completely customizable dock widgets 
  - One or more channels per dock widget
  - Whispers in tabbed per-sender UI
- Buttons to go to hideout and menagerie with just a single click
- Scripting console with support for JavaScript. 
  - If you can do it in the UI, you can do it with code (unless I missed something).
  - This will be a neat way to support custom stuff developed by the community. I have not yet added anything
    to support sharing/loading scripts, but that's the idea.
- More to come!

### Future functionality
- Incorporating much of the functionality of the famed trade macro with faster/parallel searching. I have
  ideas on how to do this.
- Handling of trade interaction through chat windows. 
  - Perhaps a dedicated trade widget for handling these interactions?
  - Hopefully solve the "already sold that" issues with poe.trade lag.
- Leveling tracker (passive quests, gear?, etc.)
- Support overlays for the game (for people who don't have a second monitor).
